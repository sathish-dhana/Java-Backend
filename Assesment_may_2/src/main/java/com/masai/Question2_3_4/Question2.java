	/*
	 * 
	 * In CAP theorem
	 * C - Consistency.
	 * A - Availability.
	 * P - Partition Tolerance.
	 * 
	 * CAP theorem states that in any distributed system having cluster of servers
	 * we cannot guarantee  all three properties. we can only satisfy any two 
	 * properties of CAP.
	 * 
	 * Basically from design aspect :
	 * it we need to design a system which require high consistency &
	 * if the system need to handle more load or traffic, then we can select 
	 * consistency & availability, we need to satisfy partition tolerance here.
