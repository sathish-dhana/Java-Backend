    before compiling & this type of error will be caught while compiling
     For example : class Not found error */

    exception based on logic
    & this type of error will not be caught while compiling

    //throw is used when we want to throw error explicitly based on business logic//
    /*throws is used to warn caller of that method to
    handle the exception thrown from current method*/

    //question 3 //
    //final is used for class variable that are meant to be constant for example: pie or sigma value//
    /*finally is provided in try catch block at last to execute
    no matter what happens, it always runs except like System.out & errors like memory error
